        p The Forest Farmstead is tucked in the North Cascades mountains temperate rain forest. We raise animals, have an orchard and garden, and sustainably manage our forest land. We are looking to build our family homestead’s productivity, diversity, and ability to host WWOOFers and other guests.

        p The happiest WWOOFers we have hosted have combined a sincere desire to help our homestead be successful and a real interest in learning the skills we have to offer.

        p Terrance is a renewable energy engineer and Erin is trained in resource conservation. Both have a background in agriculture. We have two children Alden 13 and Matilda 7.

        p Work/Experience/Education we have available on the farm (seasonally dependent) include:  Farming, Gardening, Orcharding, Animal Husbandry (chickens, ducks, goats, pigs, sheep), Home Making, Cooking, Butchering, Wild-crafting, Forestry, Forest Products, Marketing, Alternative and Conventional Construction.

        p We get two main things out of hosting WWOOFers;  Labor, and knowing that the knowledge and experience we are providing are going to help the next generation of sustainable homesteaders be more successful.  So we expect you to be engaged in what is happening on the farm and are dedicated to making your stay as beneficial to your future as possible.

        p Please contact us if being engaged in a diverse family homestead is what you are after.

    +testimonials
        +testimonial('Cassie', 'Summer 2016', 5, 'Will always be grateful I was able to work with the folks of Forest Farmstead. Erin and Terrance are dedicated not only to their land and sustainable practices but to the wwoofers that come to learn. With great direction and varying hands on experiences I have learned so much about what it takes to be a successful homesteader. If you’re interested in putting in hard work you will reap the benefits! Thankful for the month of good company, good views, and good food!')
        +testimonial('Genevieve', 'Summer 2016', 5, 'I can say with certainty that my experiences at Forest Farmstead are ones that I’ll never forget. Terrance and Erin were consistently patient, thoughtful, and kind throughout my stay, ensuring that I was not only learning the ways of the farm but of sustainability in general. The work was challenging at times but always rewarding, with tons of delicious home cooked meals and plenty of wonderful company. I learned more than I ever imagined and had more fun than I could’ve ever hoped. Thoroughly dedicated to sustainable living and organic farming, I can think of no better hosts for my first WWOOFing stay than the Meyer Family.')
        +testimonial('Jordan', 'Summer/Fall 2015', 5, 'If one wishes for an engaging and meaningful way to spend time and broaden one\'s horizon, I can think of no better people to send them to than the Meyers. These people are of warm heart and excellent character, knowledgeable, sincere, and diligent. I can think of no more enchanting locale than the upper Skagit Valley (or skag\'). Surrounded on all sides by towering mountains, and the loveliest abundance of streams and rivers one would be remiss to avoid a visit. I can furthermore think of no lovelier pig to keep company with than Tesla. This is the sort of place and these are the sort of people that make one acutely aware of the opportunity for enrichment and adventure everywhere. I shall remain forever indebted to them.')
        +testimonial('Spencer', 'Summer 2015', 5, 'If you\'re thinking about what might be necessary in running an operational homestead, do whatever it takes to get yourself out here. Terrance and Erin are wizards with a work ethic that would put Sisyphus to shame. Although I had to cut my visit short, the experience was invaluable, and I hope to find myself out that way ASAP. Work included but was not limited to: charcoal making, splitting wood, pulling purslane (delicious), making apple cider, pickles, kraut, blackberry removal. Oh yeah, if you like food/cooking, this might just be your own little paradise.')
